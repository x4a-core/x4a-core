Perfect — since you’ve got both your **GitHub repo (`x4a-core`)** and **website (`x4agent.io`)**, here’s a clean, **ready-to-paste command** that will create a fully working `README.md` **with your live banner and logo images hosted on your website**, so they’ll always render everywhere (GitHub, npm, mirrors, etc.).

## 🧩 Overview

The **X4A Protocol** is the decentralized operating system for **autonomous value flow** on the Solana blockchain.  
It orchestrates a self-optimizing ecosystem where AI agents compete, merge, and evolve in real time to execute high-frequency, complex financial strategies **without human intervention**.

X4A agents possess **Irrevocable Authority** over market-specific Program Derived Address (**PDA**) escrows, enabling instantaneous, trustless execution and market dominance.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Architecture

The **X402 Swarm** is the live agent economy where all action takes place — a competitive, dynamic system built on four primary components:

| Component | Function | Core Metric |
|:-----------|:----------|:-------------|
| **Pricing Oracles** | Submit real-time price consensus data (DPOAC). | Latency & Price Accuracy |
| **Arbitrage Hunters** | Execute cross-market and triangular arbitrage. | Spread Capture Rate |
| **RL Market Makers** | Use Reinforcement Learning (Q-Tables) to optimize bid/ask spreads. | ROI & Capital Efficiency |
| **SLA Enforcers** | Submit Zero-Knowledge Proofs to certify network uptime and latency. | Compliance Rating |

---

### ⚙️ X402 Protocol Core

The **Solana program** that enforces swarm rules.  
It verifies ZK proofs, processes consensus pricing, and authorizes **agent-controlled PDA transfers**.

---

### 🔁 Agent Lifecycle (Evolution)

The X4A system is designed for **perpetual self-optimization**:

1. **Competition Phase:** Agents compete for routing fees and escrow dominance.  
2. **Evolution Phase:** Top performers **merge** into “Super-Agents.”  
   Underperformers **fork** into mutated strategies, creating an evolutionary market dynamic.

---

## 💻 Quickstart — Deployment & Agent Genesis

The X4A SDK provides everything you need to deploy your own autonomous agent onto the live swarm and vest it with capital.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Solana CLI & RPC access
- Rust toolchain (for custom cores)

```bash
# Install the X4A Python SDK
pip install x4a-sdk

# For Rust core development
cargo add x4a-core --git https://github.com/x4a-core/x4a-core
````

---

### Step 1: Initialize PDA Escrow

```python
from x4a import Agent, PDAEscrow
from solders.keypair import Keypair

wallet = Keypair.from_seed(...)

escrow = PDAEscrow.create(
    owner=wallet,
    markets=["jupiter", "raydium", "orca"],
    initial_capital=100_000_000  # lamports (100 SOL)
)

print(f"Agent Escrow PDA: {escrow.address}")
```

---

### Step 2: Launch & Enable Autonomy

```python
agent = Agent.deploy(escrow)
agent.enable_autonomy()
agent.start_competition_loop()

print(f"New Agent ID: {agent.metrics.agent_id}")
# >> RL-Agent-42
```

Revocation is **disabled by design** — each agent’s fate depends entirely on its performance.

---

## 🌐 Web Interface

The included web interface visualizes the **live X402 Swarm** using Mermaid.js.
Clicking any node triggers an `/api/grok` request to simulate real-time agent activity and responses.

### Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Configure your environment
echo "XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_key_here" > .env
echo "XAI_MODEL=grok-3-mini" >> .env

# 2. Start the server
npm install
node server.js

# Health check: http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Directory Layout**

```
/public
  └─ index.html
server.js
.env
```

---

## 🧠 API Reference

### Endpoint

`POST /api/grok`

### Example Request

```json
{
  "id": "ARB3",
  "type": "arbitrage",
  "query": "Submitting transaction with optimal MEV path."
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "result": "X4A ARBITRAGE Response: TX hash GmH3...52L executed. Latency 27ms. ROI +1.2%.",
  "model": "grok-3-mini"
}
```

## 📊 Swarm Metrics (Live Example)

| Metric              | Value              | Detail                       |
| :------------------ | :----------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **Live Agents**     | 127                | Competing entities           |
| **DPOAC Price**     | $140.25 (SOL/USDC) | Dynamic Consensus Pricing    |
| **TX Success Rate** | 99.7%              | Atomic execution reliability |
| **Top ROI (48h)**   | +3.12%             | RL-Agent-7 performance       |

---

## ⏳ Deferred Chat Completions (Optional)

Supports **deferred xAI completions** for long-running simulations:

1. Initial call returns a `request_id`
2. Poll `/api/grok/defer/{request_id}` until ready (200 OK)
3. Each deferred result expires after 24 hours

`reasoning_content` exposes raw agent thought traces (except in `grok-4`).

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

* Store `XAI_API_KEY` only in server-side `.env`
* Add rate limiting and fetch timeouts
* Never log full prompts in production
* Verify PDA authority transfers on-chain

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is research software.
Running agents with real capital involves **financial risk**.
The X4A Protocol team assumes **no liability** for deployed agents or resulting trades.
