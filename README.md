# X4A Protocol: Autonomous Agents Market 🚀

The **X4A Protocol** is the decentralized operating system for **autonomous value flow** on the Solana blockchain. It orchestrates a self-optimizing ecosystem where AI agents compete, merge, and evolve in real time to execute high-frequency, complex financial strategies **without human intervention**.

X4A agents possess **Irrevocable Authority** over market-specific Program Derived Address (**PDA**) escrows, enabling instantaneous, trustless execution and market dominance.

---

## ✨ Why X4A

- **Live & Self-Optimizing:** Agents continuously adapt via competition, merger, and fork.
- **On-Chain Authority:** One-time PDA linkage grants agents irrevocable execution control.
- **Deterministic Speed:** Rust cores + async pipelines for sub-second decisioning.
- **Composable:** Bring your own strategies: arbitrage, RL market making, SLA proving, and more.

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Architecture

The **X402 Swarm** is the live agent economy where all action takes place. It’s a highly competitive, dynamic system built on four main components:

### 1) Agent Swarms (The Competitors)

Autonomous AI agents constantly analyze, reason, and execute transactions.

| Agent Type            | Function                                                     | Core Metric                |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Pricing Oracles**   | Submit real-time price consensus data (DPOAC).               | Latency & Price Accuracy   |
| **Arbitrage Hunters** | Execute cross-market / triangular arbitrage.                 | Spread Capture Rate        |
| **RL Market Makers**  | Reinforcement Learning (Q-Tables) to optimize bid/ask.       | ROI & Capital Efficiency   |
| **SLA Enforcers**     | Submit ZKPs certifying uptime and latency compliance.        | Compliance Rating          |

### 2) Protocol Core (X402)

The on-chain Solana program that enforces the rules of the swarm. It verifies ZK proofs, processes consensus pricing, and authorizes agent-controlled **PDA** transfers.

### 3) Lifecycle (Evolution)

The system is designed for **perpetual self-optimization**:

- **Competition Phase:** Multiple agents compete for routing fees and escrow dominance.
- **Evolution Phase:** Top-performers **Merge** their code/state into “Super-Agents.” Underperformers **Fork** into niche, mutated strategies. The swarm rapidly adapts to market conditions.

## ⚙️ Quickstart — Deployment & Agent Genesis

The X4A SDK provides everything needed to deploy your own autonomous agent into the live swarm and vest it with capital.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ for SDK and bindings
- (Optional) Rust toolchain for custom cores
- Solana toolchain (keys, RPC access)

```bash
# Install the X4A Python SDK
pip install x4a-sdk

# If developing a custom core, add the Rust dependency
cargo add x4a-core --git https://github.com/x4a-protocol/core
````

### Step 1: Initialize PDA Escrow

A one-time transaction grants your agent irrevocable authority over its dedicated PDA escrow.

```python
from x4a import Agent, PDAEscrow
from solders.keypair import Keypair

# Your wallet signs the initial authority transfer (irreversible)
wallet = Keypair.from_seed(...) 

escrow = PDAEscrow.create(
    owner=wallet,
    markets=["jupiter", "raydium", "orca"],
    initial_capital=100_000_000  # lamports (e.g., 100 SOL)
)

print(f"Agent Escrow PDA: {escrow.address}")
```

### Step 2: Launch & Enable Autonomy

The agent begins its autonomous competition loop using your provided logic. **Revocation is disabled by design** — the agent lives or dies by performance.

```python
# Agent deploys to the X402 Swarm and registers its PDA
agent = Agent.deploy(escrow)

# The critical step: granting the agent self-control authority
agent.enable_autonomy()

# Start the continuous competition cycle
agent.start_competition_loop()

# Track performance in real time
print(f"New Agent ID: {agent.metrics.agent_id}")
# >> RL-Agent-42
```

## 🖥️ Web UI — Live Agent Interaction

The included web interface demonstrates live agent status and protocol interactions, with a Mermaid-rendered swarm diagram. Click any component to fire a live query via the backend proxy.

### Run the Dev Server

```bash
# 1) Create .env
echo "XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_key_here" > .env
# optional, choose a valid xAI model (e.g. grok-3, grok-3-mini, grok-4-0709)
echo "XAI_MODEL=grok-3-mini" >> .env

# 2) Install deps & start
npm install
node server.js

# Server will serve /public and proxy POST /api/grok
# Health check: http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Directory layout (minimal):**

```
/public
  └─ index.html     # front-end (swarm diagram, log viewer)
server.js           # express server, xAI proxy
.env                # XAI_API_KEY, XAI_MODEL
```

---

## 📡 API Reference — Querying Agent State

The UI sends requests to the backend, which proxies the xAI Chat Completions API and normalizes results.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/grok`
**Body:**

```json
{
  "id": "ARB3",
  "type": "arbitrage",
  "query": "Submitting transaction with optimal MEV path."
}
```

**Response (normalized):**

```json
{
  "result": "X4A ARBITRAGE Response: ... concise terminal-style output ...",
  "choices": [ /* raw choices if present */ ],
  "model": "grok-3-mini"
}
```

### Common Components & Example Queries

| Component ID | Example Query                                      |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `RL1`        | Requesting optimal Q-value for spread adjustment.  |
| `ARB3`       | Submitting transaction with optimal MEV path.      |
| `POC`        | Querying current consensus price.                  |
| `SLA2`       | Requesting proof of sub-200ms transaction latency. |
| `LP2`        | Querying winning agent bid from ELP.               |
| `X402`       | Querying program current state.                    |

The system returns a concise, terminal-style response with on-chain flavored metrics (prices, latencies, TX hashes, ROI), reflecting the agent’s current task and performance.

## 🧩 Optional: Deferred Chat Completions

If you prefer **deferred** results (create → poll once available):

* Create a new server route (e.g. `POST /api/grok/defer`) to call xAI’s deferred endpoint and return a `request_id`.
* Poll with `GET /api/grok/defer/:request_id` every few seconds until the backend relays a ready response (200) instead of 202.

> Advantages: offloads long generations; one-time retrieval within 24h; supports tracing via `message.reasoning_content` (except on models that don’t emit it).

---

## 🔐 Security & Operational Notes

* **Key Management:** Load `XAI_API_KEY` via environment variables. Never ship keys to the browser.
* **Rate Limiting:** Add express middleware (e.g. `express-rate-limit`) to `/api/grok` to prevent spam clicks.
* **Timeouts & Retries:** Wrap outbound fetches with `AbortController` and conservative timeouts (10–15s).
* **CORS:** Lock down `origin` in production.
* **Observability:** Log request IDs and response summaries only; avoid full prompt logging in prod.

---

## 🧭 Development Tips

* Use **Mermaid** in the UI to visualize the swarm. Each node triggers a click callback → `/api/grok`.
* Keep front-end resilient: prefer `data.result` with fallback to `choices[0].message.content`.
* Make the model selectable via `XAI_MODEL` to tune cost/quality without code changes.
